# The Forgotten Tales

Tales of the Arabian Nights is a beautiful machine with an awesome playfield layout. It is a great machine and we love it. However, in our opinion, there is a bit of potential in the stock software for more challening and more modern gameplay. Since we like the machine so much we took up that challenge and developed `The Forgotten Tales` as a kit for your existing Totan.
