# The Forgotten Tales

Tales of the Arabian Nights (tm) is a beautiful machine with an awesome playfield layout. It is a great machine and we love it. However, in our opinion, there is a bit of potential in the stock software for more challening and more modern gameplay. Since we like the machine so much we took up that challenge and developed `The Forgotten Tales (tm)` as a kit for your existing Totan.

## What is it?

The Forgotten Tales (tm) replaces the original CPU and sound boards in the backbox. Additionally, the speaker panel is replaced with new artwork, new 2-way stereo speakers, 7 RGB inserts and a RGB DMD (based on the awesome[Pin2DMD](https://pin2dmd.com/)). Furthermore, there you get a new powerful subwoofer and an autoplunger. The new CPU and sound board (based on the great [tilt!audio board](https://tiltaudio.com/)) runs new software with 7 additional tales, 5 new multiballs, 2 new video modes and more. It plays new music and more callouts from the original voice actor in stereo via a modern sound card and two digital amplifiers.
